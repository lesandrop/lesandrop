### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi. I'm Lesandro Ponciano. I research and teach Human-Computer Interaction, Cooperative Systems, Scientific Methodology, and other cool things in the area of Information Systems and Software Engineering. Yes, you are right: I love computers and people; I also love science and education. You're right again, I still code, less often than I would like, but I code.
